Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah. It's my experience of build a cross-platform software with Python.

At first, as a part of preparing my environment, I created a virtual environment under the project folder.

```bash
$python -m venv venv
```

You can find in detailed about virtual environment [here][1]. Now I have one folder under the project root folder. Next for running virtual environment, I have to run the `activate` file under the `venv/bin/activate` with the command -

```bash
$source venv/bin/activate
```

Virtual Environment activated, Alhamadulillah! Added the command as a alias: `litv`. Now init and commit to GitHub! ðŸ˜‰



```bash
.
â””â”€â”€ venv #virtual environment folder
```
